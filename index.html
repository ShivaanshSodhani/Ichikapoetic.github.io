            <p>It says quietly my name</p>

            <p>And lights a fire</p>
            <p>Sitting by the river</p>

            <p>A cause now smoke, she burnt too brightly</p>
            <p>A bard her home, she lives so lightly</p>

            <p>With a song in her mind</p>
            <p>Perhaps theirs only</p>
            <p>Tired and tired of lurking in shallows</p>
            <p>She jumps in a pool that seems very gentle</p>
            <p>As it helps her in instead of throwing her out</p>
            <p>She feels belonged, hers is the only sound</p>
            <p>Looking at the world, so still for once</p>

            <p>Because I watched my home</p>

            <p>Awakening light of thunder</p>

            <p>It makes my throat warm</p>
            <p>Till I puke out all the kisses</p>
            <p>That ever touched my lips</p>
            <p>And left them stone cold</p>

            <p>don't know what I want</p>
            <p>Then I say can u make this end</p>
            <p>She says sure, but is that really</p>

            <p>Ireally don't know, I'm tired</p>
            <p>But I think again, this time calm</p>
            <p>And I ask can you make me feel the</p>
            <p>way I did before</p>
            <p>Can I go back to being myself</p>
            <p>again?</p>
            <p>She says no because she can't fulfil</p>
            <p>something</p>
            <p>That she doesn't understand</p>
            <p>She says I don't know who you were</p>
            <p>before</p>
            <p>But I don't see any shortcomings in</p>
            <p>you now</p>
            <p>What is it that you feel you have</p>
            <p>lost?</p>
            <p>I say my soul, its long gone</p>
            <p>The lady starts to laugh</p>
            <p>I don't understand what's so funny</p>
            <p>She says do you know what you</p>
            <p>were in your past life</p>
            <p>I say no, confused</p>
            <p>She said an ant, a mouse and before</p>
            <p>that a tree</p>
            <p>And in all these bodies, you were</p>
            <p>still you</p>
            <p>You liked the same smells, the same</p>
            <p>things set you free</p>
            <p>And your soul honey, its long but not</p>
            <p>gone</p>
            <p>Its deep, too deep to be touched by</p>
            <p>any trouble</p>
            <p>its still in you, you just don't reach</p>
            <p>out to it anymore</p>
            <p>Now hurry and wish because I have</p>
            <p>work to do</p>
            <p>I wish everyone listens to their soul</p>
            <p>and hold on to the melody of their minds</p>

            <p>I really like your distinct grin</p>
            <p>Do you like the tiny mole on my</p>

            <p>through</p>
            <p>Why do first times matter</p>
            <p>If in the end, it was all in my head</p>

            <p>The last has power to bring to shore</p>
            <p>Or drown me deeper in the</p>
